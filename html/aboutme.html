  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! My name is John Chakkour, and I'm a sophomore at the University of Toronto with a passion for math, 
    computer science, and all things tech. I also love football (<em>real</em> football), and when I have time, I play the 
    piano.</p>
  <p>You can check out the code for this website on <a href="https://github.com/johnchakkour/johnchakkour.github.io" 
                                                       target="_blank">GitHub.</a> As you can tell, I'm still working on it.</p>
